Maarten Steenhagen is a philosopher, working on the philosophy of perception and philosophical questions about representation. He currently works as a doctoral researcher at University College London. His work is informed by current developments in philosophy of psychology, cognitive science, psychoanalysis and art history. In general, he is interested in the nature of human perceptual encounters with representational and expressive artefacts found in linguistic, but especially in pictorial and diagrammatic practices.

Derek Matravers' interest in empathy stemmed from his involvement in a project run by Amy Coplan (of Cal State Fullerton) and the late Peter Goldie (the Samuel Hall Professor in Manchester). This culminated in a large international conference and an edited collection in which Matravers has a paper (Empathy: Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives (OUP, 2011)). He is contracted to write a book on empathy for Polity Press, to be published in 2014.

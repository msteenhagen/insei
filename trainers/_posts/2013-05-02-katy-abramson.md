Kate Abramson is a philosopher who works in contemporary ethics, early modern ethics (especially David Hume and Adam Smith), and philosophical feminism. Her interest in issues concerning sympathy and empathy in some ways lies at the heart of all her work. For instance, the well-known variabilities of sympathy have been the source of objections to Hume’s sympathy-based ethics. Well into the 1990s, the standard view was that Hume’s sympathy-based account of moral evaluation must be either hopelessly subjectivist, or problematically relativist. Instead, she has argued, Hume is able to give a plausible, deeply pluralist, and intersubjectively valid, account of our practices of moral evaluation.

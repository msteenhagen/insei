Katherine Harloe is a classicist with philosophical training, who works on the history of early modern ideas as well as the ancient world. Her interest in sympathy and empathy stems from concern with in the ways in which the concepts have featured in debates over of historical methodology in the tradition from Herder to Collingwood. For example, her recent monograph, *Winckelmann and the invention of antiquity* (OUP 2013), includes a chapter which deals with Johann Gottfried Herder's formulation of 'Einfühlung' or 'Divination' as a condition of, but also a challenge, to historical understanding.

As an anthropologist, Holly High is interested in how her discipline claims to produce knowledge through fieldwork. Her own experiences in Laos led her to suggest refinements to how we write and teach about anthropological methods. She has been inspired by psychoanalytic approaches to understanding human interaction, and is now interested in what a concerted enquiry into "empathy" might add to our understanding of the rise and popularity of "participant observation" methods in the last century and to efforts at refining and reflecting on contemporary anthropological fieldwork.

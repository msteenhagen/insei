Constanze Güthenke is Associate Professor of Classics and Hellenic Studies at Princeton University, where she has taught since 2003. Trained in the UK, she is by inclination both a classicist and a comparatist, working on classical knowledge and the perception of antiquity, especially since 1800, in a European and a transnational context. A recurring topic of her research to date has been the attitudes and affective states vis-à-vis antiquity, expressed in a variety of genres, from poetry to scholarship.
